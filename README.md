# Resistor Color Bands 

4 band Resistor Color Code Converter and Calculator example is a free open source converter using Django's web framework backend along with Javascript as the frontend.
When I initially ventured into creating Windows applications with Python, it marked one of my earliest projects. The process has become significantly more streamlined with the integration of the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript as the programming language.
This application was once written only using Django and css but now uses both Javascript and Django. Django is good to use for a web framework because of it's Model Template View(mtv) Structure 
but I was unable to change the color of the bands without having to submit the form because once the page is loaded nothing happens in Django until the page is loaded again. This is where Javascript 
shines because you can run animations and select option events without having to reload the page by using the Document Object Model(dom) for html pages, pretty neat huh. So I try to leverage both
programming languages because they are both good at what they were designed to do. Someone who is new to Javascript and/or Django might fine this app useful, all of the code is open source and can
be used freely. The only requirement for this repository is Django as Javascript can be run inside of any html page. All the files needed for this app are in the folder called 'rcb'.
